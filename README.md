# 💰 Budget Tracker

A web-based personal finance management application that helps individuals and households track income, expenses, EMIs, and budgets — with rich reporting, charts, and email alerts to support smarter financial decisions.

Built with **Django**, **MySQL**, **HTML/CSS**, and a documented **REST API** (via DRF + Swagger).

---

## 📌 Overview

Budget Tracker gives users a centralized platform to:

- Record and categorize income and expenses
- Set monthly budgets per category and track progress
- Visualize spending trends through charts and graphs
- Generate downloadable/scheduled PDF financial reports
- Receive email notifications for bill reminders, overspending, and budget alerts

The goal is simple: make it easy to see where your money goes, plan ahead, and stay on top of your financial goals.

2. **User Input** — Income, expenses, EMIs, and budgets are entered and categorized
3. **Data Storage** — Entries are securely stored in MySQL
4. **Data Processing** — The backend aggregates data and calculates balances/insights

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- MySQL Server
- pip / virtualenv

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/budget-tracker.git
cd budget-tracker

# Create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Configure the Database

Update the `DATABASES` settings in `myapp/settings.py` with your MySQL credentials:

```python
DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.mysql',
        'NAME': 'budgettracker',
        'USER': '<your-mysql-username>',
        'PASSWORD': '<your-mysql-password>',
        'HOST': 'localhost',
        'PORT': '3306',
    }
}
```

> ⚠️ Don't commit real credentials or `SECRET_KEY` values to version control — use environment variables (e.g. via `python-decouple` or `django-environ`) for production.

### Run Migrations & Start the Server

```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py createsuperuser
